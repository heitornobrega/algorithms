# Problem Solving and Algorithm Optimization Project

This project aimed to train problem-solving skills and algorithm optimization using concepts such as algorithm complexity analysis, recursion, and sorting and searching algorithms.

## Why was this important?

Whiteboard problem-solving exercises not only train our problem-solving skills but also improve our logic and prepare us to deal with everyday problematic situations. Additionally, the ability to optimize algorithms is crucial to writing efficient code, reducing execution time and improving code quality.

## What was developed?

This was an individual project with the objective of solving different problems using the concepts learned in the previous section, such as complexity analysis, recursion, and sorting and searching algorithms.

The problems were of the type that appear in numerous whiteboard interview processes and accelerated the participant's problem-solving ability.

To achieve the project's goal, several skills were required, including:

- Logic;
- Interpretation of the problem;
- Interpretation of legacy code;
- Problem-solving ability, in an optimized way;
- Ability to solve problems/optimize algorithms even under pressure.

## Evaluation

The code was evaluated based on:

- The organization and adherence of the code to the specification;
- Compliance with the required complexity in each requirement;
- Development of the requirements using the specified approaches.

## Conclusion

This project aimed to train problem-solving skills and algorithm optimization, fundamental skills for software developers. The ability to solve problems and optimize algorithms is essential not only in the interview process but also in dealing with everyday problematic situations and writing efficient code.
